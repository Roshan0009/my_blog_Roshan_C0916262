        After completing my higher secondary education (+2) in Nepal, I embarked
        on a journey to further my academic pursuits in Canada, choosing to
        specialize in computer programming at Lambton College in Toronto. This
        transition marked a significant step in my educational journey,
        immersing myself in a diverse and challenging learning environment.
        Currently in my second semester, I am finding the experience immensely <!-- this the middle section of webpages that contain the image of collage
        and the psragraph-->
        rewarding; I am acquiring a wealth of knowledge and developing a deeper
        understanding of programming concepts. The decision to study abroad has
        been instrumental in broadening my perspectives and enhancing my skills
        in this dynamic field.
